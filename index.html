												<li><strong>YouTube Video</strong>: Make sure that the first media you attach to the post is a YouTube video. You can either manually embed the video or use the text editor to browse the respective video and insert it into your post.</li>
												<li><strong>Featured post</strong>: If you want your post to stand out, add the label "Featured" (case sensitive) and make sure to attach at least one image or a YouTube video. The featured post layout will display the image in a larger format with the title and summary, making the post more prominent.</li>
											</ul>
										</section>
										<section class="inner mb-5" id="managelayout">
											<h4 class="title">2.4. Manage Layout and Gadget</h4>
											<p>
												The theme comes with various sections that hold gadgets. Each section's label indicates the name of the corresponding gadget, such as <strong>Header</strong> for the header gadget or <strong>Navigation</strong> for the Pages gadget. To preserve the theme's layout, most sections are locked and can only hold specific gadgets that match their intended purpose. However, you add any number of gadgets into sidebar and footer.
											</p>
											<h5 class="title mb-2">Add gadgets</h5>
											<p>
												To add a gadget, in the left menu, select <strong>Layout > Add a Gadget</strong>. This will trigger pop-up window that contains all Blogger's default gadgets, including popular posts, contact, label, archive, etc. Those gadgets can be added to your blog by clicking the plus <code>+</code> icon.

											<p>
												If you use an image logo, the image will display at its maximum dimensions. For example, if the image you upload is 200 x 150px, then our theme will display your logo image at 200 x 150px.
											</p>
											<p>
												To avoid images looking blurry on retina display devices, it is best to use a larger image that is displayed at a smaller size on the website. For example, if you want your logo to show up as a 200 x 150px image on the website, it is best to upload an image that is 400 x 300px, and simply tell the theme to display it at 200 x 150px.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can upload your logo as usual from the <strong>Layout > Header</strong> gadget. To update the size of your logo, navigate to Theme Designer&trade; then choose <strong>Advanced</strong>. Select <strong>Header</strong> from the dropdown and resize the logo width by chaging the value of the <strong>Logo width</strong> option. Logo height will adjust automatically acording to its aspect ratio.

										<section class="inner mb-5" id="autopagination">
											<h4 class="title post-header mb-3">3.1. Number of post per page isn't correct</h2>
											<p>
												Blogger has introduced a mechanism called "auto pagination" to reduce the loading time of its blogs. This mechanism is to show less entries per page if it detects that the page is heavy to load. Quick workaround to prevent it from working is by adding jump-break/read-more after the first paragraph on each affected post.
											</p>
											<p>Best practice is to compress all images, delete gadgets you don't need, and not doing copy-paste on content.</p>

											<h4 class="title post-header mb-3">3.3. Error PageList1 gadget (invalid)</h2>
											<p>
												It is likely your navigation gadget uses codes or characters not supported with Blogger recent theme HTML updates. To fix it, at the theme <strong>Edit HTML</strong> page, click <strong>Jump to Widget</strong> icon. In the dropdown list, selected <strong>PageList1</strong>, then click <strong>Revert gadget to default</strong>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Else you can delete any special and accented character in your navigation label and URL, e.g. #, —, â, î or ô, or use only alphanumeric.

                        Ensure the reader access is set to Public and each post has at least one label, else the related post script won't be able to read the post data.
